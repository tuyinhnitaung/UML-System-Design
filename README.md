# UML System Design â€“ Event & Maintenance Management

This repository showcases my **UML modeling and system design skills** using [Visual Paradigm](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/).  
It contains both the original `.vpp` project file and exported **SVG diagrams** for clear, friendly viewing.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The system modeled here is an **Event and Maintenance Management System**, designed to streamline the handling of events, requests, and maintenance operations.  

The project demonstrates:
- **Use Case Modeling** â€“ capturing system functionality from the userâ€™s perspective  
- **Activity Modeling** â€“ visualizing step-by-step workflows  
- **System Management Views** â€“ showing how events and maintenance tasks are created, managed, and completed  
- **Class Diagrams (inside `.vpp`)** â€“ outlining the object-oriented architecture
